OBJECTS IN JS
Javascript is an object oriented.
Object properties and methods must start with letters.
They can include numbers after the first character and may not
contain dashes or hyphens. Property names may include spaces,
method names may not.

Example:

let example1 = {
    color: "purple",
    smile: function() { console.log("Hi " + color); }
};

It should be declared with curly braces{},
every key value should be seperated by commas.
Javascript functions defined as part of an object have a scope
isolated from the rest of the object. If a function must access
information stored in other object properties or call other object
functions.

The dot operator (.) accesses properties and methods inside an object.
 Since a dot has this special meaning, a property or method name
  cannot contain a dot. Multiple dots are only valid while accessing
   properties if they refer to objects nested inside each other.
